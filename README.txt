    This folder contains:
        1. Required classes for running the games of Whitejack, Greyjack, and Blackjack
        2. A gambling program (Gambling.py) which generates a policy for a Blackjack game with a POMDP
        3. A folder (results) with the results from using the program

====================
    INSTRUCTIONS
====================
    Simply run Gambling.py to generate the policy against a dealer who hits until he scores > 17 
        `python Gambling.py`

    You may also pipe the results of this gambling excercise to an output file.

=====================================
    NAVIGATING THE RESULTS FOLDER
=====================================
    
    Results files are (and should be) named as follows:
        `[USER_ID]_blackjack.txt`
    
    For example a policy generated by me would be:
        `aim27_blackjack.txt`

    Each results file records the state to action mapping (policy) for a game played
    At the top of each file, you will also find my NAME, USER_ID, and HANDLE
    
    Only one results file is included in the folder. However, the code is 
    extensible and you may create your own dealer policies, and generate
    other results.

=====================================
    UNDERSTANDING RESULTS OUTPUT
=====================================

The output presented in a results file looks like this:

    4,11: hit
    4,2: hit
    4,3: hit
    4,4: hit
    4,5: hit
    4,6: hit
    4,7: hit
    4,8: hit
    4,9: hit
    4,10: hit
    5,11: hit
    5,2: hit
    5,3: hit
    .
    .
    .

Where: 
1. The first value on each line represents the player's state 
2. The second value represents the observed dealer's card 
3. The last value represents the action to be taken
